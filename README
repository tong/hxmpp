DISKTREE.NET HAXE JABBER/XMPP - README
======================================
hxmpp is a async haXe[03] library for creation of jabber clients and components.
The library consists of two main parts:
* xmpp: creation and manipulation of xmpp packets.
* jabber: creation and handling of xmpp streams between jabber entities.

For further information on jabber visit [04][05].

BUILD+INSTALLATION
------------------
Run the hxml files in the main directory to build included demos, tests and utilities.

# Compiler flags:
* JABBER_DEBUG   Prints debug information, adds toString() methods to some classes.
* JABBER_SOCKETBRIDGE   Use a socket bridge for io connection (see: jabber.tool.SocketBridge).
* JABBER_LIBCLIENT
* XEP_0091   Ensures backward compatibility with XEP-0091 when using jabber.DelayedDelivery. 

# neko
Copy the ndlls to your neko installation.
* sha1.ndll is required for SHA1 encoding.
* hxmpp_debug.ndll for colored xmpp debug bash output (linux only).

# flash9+
-) You have to allow the flash player to connect to the web if running local ( [06] ).
-) Since version 9,0,124,0, flash player does not allow you to make a socket connection directly to a server
without first obtaining explicit permission from that server in form of a policy-file-request ( [07] for further information ).
You can download a simple flash-policy-server for neko from [08][09].

# js
You have two possibilities using hxmpp from javascript:
-) Code your application in haXe and compile to javascript.
-) Compile all required classes into a javascript file then call it from plain js (check /bin/demo/client_js.html for example and jabber.Lib class ). 
(The current version includes a pre-compiled javascript file including basic features every jabber client should have (/bin/hxmpp_client.js).)
Since ther is no BOSH implementation so far connections could be made with an (invisible) flash9 movie acting as socket bridge.

# actionscript3
-) look at /demo/JabberClientDemo.as for an actionscript3 usage example.
